# Quick-Refrence

A codeschool project created by Blake Cook, Jorge Gomez, and Seth Nielson.

## Key Feature

This project was a website for creating tutorials for later use or sharing. It's purpose was to solve the problem of needing a way to record your knowledge while it's fresh. For example, if someone has a multi-step task that they know will need to be repeated in the distant future, then they can create a tutorial for their future self.
